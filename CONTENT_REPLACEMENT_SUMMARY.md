```

**Note**: The placeholder image files are currently SVG graphics with .jpg/.png extensions. 
This is intentional - you can simply replace them with your actual JPG or PNG images 
using the same filenames. The browser will display them correctly regardless.

## Placeholders to Replace

### Images (9 files)
All placeholder images are SVG-based graphics that clearly indicate what should replace them. Simply replace these files with your actual images while keeping the same filenames.

### Audio Files (3 files)
Empty MP3 files that should be replaced with actual music preview tracks (30-60 seconds recommended).

### Text Content
Search for and replace these text placeholders in `index.html`:

1. **Artist Names**: "Artist Name 1", "Artist Name 2", "Artist Name 3"
2. **Genres**: "[Genre Placeholder]"
3. **Album Titles**: "Album Title 1", "Album Title 2", "Album Title 3"
4. **About Text**: "[Replace with your record label story and mission statement]"
5. **Contact Info**: "[Your Phone Number]", "[Your Address]"
6. **Year Founded**: "[Year]"
7. **Social Media Links**: All `href="#"` in footer links
